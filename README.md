# Portfolio
## Description

To create a portfolio, using new React skills and share the already completed projects to show the full-stack skills. This portfolio page will serve to share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
